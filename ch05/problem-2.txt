Is it possible for two different expressions to have the same Gödel number?
If so, give an example.  If not, explain the impossibility.

From http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_arithmetic

   In number theory, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (or the
   unique-prime-factorization theorem) states that any integer greater than
   1 can be written as a unique product (up to ordering of the factors) of
   prime numbers.

Since an integer has a single factorization, each integer corresponds to at
most one expression.  (It is possible that an integer does not correspond
to an expression, e.g. the number 2^16 does not translate to an expression
since no symbol has the code number "16" associated with it.)  So it is not
possible for two different expressions to have the same Gödel number.
