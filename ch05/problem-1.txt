Problem:

Write out the GÃ¶del numbers for the integers 0, 1, 2, and 3.

   symbol   code
   ------   -----
      0        1
      s        2

Answers:

The integer 0 has its own symbol (0, code "1")

   2^1 = 2

The integer 1 is the successor to 0 ("s0", codes "2","1")

   2^2 * 3^1 = 12

The integer 2 is ss0 (codes "2", "2", "1")

   2^2 * 3^2 * 5^1 = 4 * 9 * 5 = 180

The integer 3 is sss0 (codes "2", "2", "2", "1")

   2^2 * 3^2 * 5^2 * 7^1 = 4 * 9 * 25 * 7 = 6300
